# An end-to-end chatbot refers to a chatbot that can handle a complete conversation from start to finish without requiring human assistance. To create an end-to-end chatbot, you need to write a computer program that can understand user requests, generate appropriate responses, and take action when necessary. This involves collecting data, choosing a programming language and NLP tools, training the chatbot, and testing and refining it before making it available to users.
# 
# ### Steps to follow:
# 1. Define Intents
# 2. Create training data
# 3. Train the chatbot
# 4. Build the chatbot
# 5. Test the chatbot
# 6. Deploy the chatbot

# The chatbot is created now . 
#After running the above code, we can interact with the chatbot in the terminal itself. 
#To turn this chatbot into an end-to-end chatbot, we need to deploy it to interact with the chatbot.
#using an user interface. To deploy the chatbot, I will use the streamlit library, which provides 
#amazing features to create a user interface for a Machine Learning application in just a few lines of code.
